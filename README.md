# Churn-Classification-Analysis
Predicting customer churn using a supervised machine learning model on Telco customer data.

## Future Steps
- Implement hyperparameter tuning 
- Test additional models: Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM
- Experiment with downsampling 
- Address model overfitting/underfitting
- Apply Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation
- Compare the performance of all the models including the ones to be added
